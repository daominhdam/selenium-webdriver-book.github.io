  "body": "Free, Selenium 3.0 compatible, and at over 420 pages this book will help you learn the fundamentals of the WebDriver API such as locating and interacting with web pages, through advanced topics such as Page Objects and mobile testing, and finally teach you how to build up your own web application testing framework\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nThis book is a hands-on guide to dozens of specific ways you can use to get the most of WebDriver in your test automation development. This practical handbook gives you instantly-useful solutions for important areas like interacting with and testing web applications and using the WebDriver APIs. As you read, you'll graduate from WebDriver fundamentals to must-have practices ranging from how to interact with, control and verify web pages and exception handling, to more complex interactions like page objects, alerts, and JavaScript, as well as, mobile testing, and much more. Finally, you'll learn how to build your own framework. By the end of the book, you’ll be confident and skilled at testing your web applications with WebDriver.\r\n\r\n### About the technology\r\n\r\nWeb applications are difficult to test because so much depends on the way a user interacts with individual pages. The Selenium WebDriver web testing framework helps you build reliable and maintainable test automation for your web applications across multiple browsers, operating systems and programming languages. Much like a human, it can click on links, fill out forms, and read the web pages, and unlike a human, it does not get bored. WebDriver can do nearly anything you ask it to—the trick is to come up with a unified approach to testing. Fortunately, that’s where this book really shines.\r\n\r\n###What's inside\r\n\r\n* Specific, practical WebDriver techniques\r\n* Interacting with, controlling, and testing web applications\r\n* Using the WebDriver APIs\r\n* Making maintainable tests\r\n* Automated testing techniques\r\n\r\n### Table of Contents\r\n\r\nPart 1: Fundamentals\r\n\r\nChapter 1: First Steps\r\nChapter 2: Locating elements on a page\r\nChapter 3: Interacting with elements on a page\r\nChapter 4: Examining a page\r\nChapter 4: Making maintainable tests using the Page Object pattern\r\nChapter 6: What To Do When Something Goes Wrong\r\n\r\nPart 2: WebDriver APIs In Depth\r\n\r\nChapter 7: Managing WebDriver\r\nChapter 8: Windows, pop-ups, and frames\r\nChapter 9: Unicorns and other beasts: Exotic features of web pages\r\nChapter 10: Executing JavaScript using the JavascriptExecutor interface\r\nChapter 11: What you need to know about different browsers\r\nChapter 12: Wrapping WebDriver and WebElement\r\n\r\nPart 3: Page Based Automation Framework\r\n\r\nChapter 13: Forming a Framework\r\nChapter 14: Encapsulating and Grouping elements\r\nChapter 15: Automating a page flow\r\nChapter 16: Examining HTML Tables\r\nChapter 17: Automating jQuery Datepicker\r\nChapter 18: Datepicker Framework\r\n\r\nAppendicies\r\n\r\nAppendix A: Selenium Grid",
