        <p>Free, Selenium 3.0 compatible, and at over 420 pages this book will help you learn the fundamentals of the WebDriver API such as locating and interacting with web pages, through advanced topics such as Page Objects and mobile testing, and finally teach you how to build up your own web application testing framework</p>

<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>This book is a hands-on guide to dozens of specific ways you can use to get the most of WebDriver in your test automation development. This practical handbook gives you instantly-useful solutions for important areas like interacting with and testing web applications and using the WebDriver APIs. As you read, you'll graduate from WebDriver fundamentals to must-have practices ranging from how to interact with, control and verify web pages and exception handling, to more complex interactions like page objects, alerts, and JavaScript, as well as, mobile testing, and much more. Finally, you'll learn how to build your own framework. By the end of the book, you’ll be confident and skilled at testing your web applications with WebDriver.</p>

<p>Web applications are difficult to test because so much depends on the way a user interacts with individual pages. The Selenium WebDriver web testing framework helps you build reliable and maintainable test automation for your web applications across multiple browsers, operating systems and programming languages. Much like a human, it can click on links, fill out forms, and read the web pages, and unlike a human, it does not get bored. WebDriver can do nearly anything you ask it to—the trick is to come up with a unified approach to testing. Fortunately, that’s where this book really shines.</p>
